# Problem Statement

Most of the advertisements on hoardings are expensive and there is no way to identify the number of views a hoarding got. Also many times the advertisements on the hoardings do not target the audience who live or travel around the area hence making the advertisement less useful . This makes many government and private sector advertisements worthless or unnecessary in that area. Our solution overcomes the issues by providing methods to determine the total views of a hoarding advertisement .

# Solution
We have used cameras which detect the eyes of people who are looking at the hoardings by using head pose detection. Through this  we can detect people where they are actually looking at by setting specific angles . The camera will be able to detect the angle of face and also the direction of eyes. If the specified parameters hold true for a minimum of three seconds the camera will detect the advertisement as seen. The overall data is analysed using  dlib and OpenCV libraries.
